# Data
If you don't have the review dataset, download it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joelljungstrom/128k-airline-reviews/). You will also need [this dataset](https://github.com/lxndrblz/Airports/blob/main/airports.csv) for airport code replacement. Add them both to the data_processing folder and run the script to get the processed datset.
